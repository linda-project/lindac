# lindac

lindac is the official compiler for the Linda Programming Language.

Linda is a language that:

- aims to provide a great development experience for both library and application authors
- aims to perform an even more in-depth analysis of your code, when compared to TypeScript
- aims to provide great tooling for developers out-of-the-box

> :warning: Even though Linda is still under development, the plan is to achieve maximum compatibility between it and TypeScript or JavaScript.
>
> Furthermore, if the transition from TypeScript to Linda isn't as simple as changing the file extension of your source files, codemods will be provided for that purpose.
